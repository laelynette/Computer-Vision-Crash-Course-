<h2 align="center">👀 Computer Vision</h2>

<p align="justify">Hi! I am currently studying data science, and this repository contains my hands-on activities and projects related to computer vision.</p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">📚 Summary of Learnings</h2>

<p align="justify"><strong>🖼️ Basic I/O Scripting (Images)</strong><br>
- This activity helped to explore and understand some basic image operations using OpenCV. I was able to learn how to read, write, and manipulate the color of images. Moreover, I learned how to access the pixel data of an image and copy-paste it to another picture.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>🎥 Basic I/O Scripting (Videos)</strong><br>
- With the use of OpenCV, I've learned how to implement VideoCapture and VideoWriter to read and write to video files. I was also able to capture frames from my camera and display them in windows. For video playback, it's necessary to use waitKey() to keep the window open while the video is being shown.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>✨ Edge and Contour Detection</strong><br>
- I explored how to apply different filters to images, highlighting various aspects like edges, details, or textures. These techniques can be used for image manipulation, feature extraction, and object detection.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>🌀 Line and Circle Detection</strong><br>
- In this task, I implemented OpenCV's APIs for Hough Transform, used for line and circle detection. I observed the effects when changing the parameter 'n' in the median blur operation. Larger values of 'n' result in a stronger blur, reducing noise and improving detection accuracy. Meanwhile, smaller values increase sensitivity to noise, potentially detecting more circles than expected. Additionally, I performed a task to count the number of coins present in an image using either line or circle detection techniques.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>😊 Face Detection using OpenCV</strong><br>
- Through this activity, I was able to detect faces using OpenCV's Haar cascades. I learned about the detectMultiScale method and its parameters. Moreover, I implemented face detection on both images and live video. I also modified the code to change the color of the detected face border and adjust its thickness for better visualization.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>👥 Performing Face Recognition</strong><br>
- I explored face recognition using algorithms like Eigenface and Local Binary Pattern Histograms (LBPH). I trained the model with the use of our faces, and it successfully recognized the members and even unknown faces. The predict() method is used to return a two-element array containing the predicted label and the associated confidence score for the recognized face. These values are important for identifying an individual and analyzing the certainty of the recognition.</p>
